### Setting Up the Contact Form

The contact form uses **Formspree** to function. It will not work out-of-the-box after cloning. To get it working, you need to:

1.  **Create a free Formspree account** at [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/).
2.  Create a new form and you will be given a unique URL endpoint.
3.  Open the `index.html` file and find the `<form>` element in the "Contact Section".
4.  Replace the `action` attribute's placeholder value with your unique Formspree URL:

    ```html
    <!-- In index.html, find the contact form -->
    <form id="contact-form"
          action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_CODE" <!-- üëà Replace this URL -->
          method="POST"
          class="space-y-6">

        <!-- ... all your form inputs are here ... -->

    </form>
    ```
5. Make sure your input fields have a `name` attribute (e.g., `<input type="email" name="email">`), as Formspree uses these names to structure the submitted data.
